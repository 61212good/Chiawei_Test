1. Please answer the following calculation. (10%)

(1.) 17 (hexadecimal)+50 (octal) = ?? (decimal) (5%)

(2.) 101 (binary) + 30 (octal)=?? (decimal) (5%)

2. What is the "resolution" of one image/picture? (5%)

3. Please explain the difference between a Stack and a Queue. (10%)

4. Please use the C language to write the code to solve the Fibonacci Sequence in two ways. (The MAIN function should be included.) (25%)

(1.) Using the Loop method. (i.e.. For, While, Do-While) (10%)

(2.) Using the Recursion method. (10%)

(3.) Please explain the difference between the Loop method and the Recursion method. (5%) 
PS: Fibonacci Sequence: F(1)=1, F(2)=1, If n>2, F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2)

5. The disk is currently at Cylinder 52. If the cylinder requests are listed in the following order in which they were received. (20%)

42, 14, 24, 68, 69, 35, 82

(1.) Please list the order in which these requests are handled if using the SCAN disk-scheduling algorithm. The read/write heads are moving toward the higher cylinder numbers. (10%)

(2.) Please list the order in which these requests are handled if using the SSTF (Shortest-Seek-Time-First) disk-scheduling algorithm. (10%)

6. Please explain the following questions about the Heap. (10%) 

(1.) What kind of tree is the Heap? (5%)

(2.) If we implement the Heap using an one-dimensional array, please explain how to calculate the relationship of index values between the parent node and the right-child node. (5%)

7. Please explain the following questions about the TCP. (20%)
